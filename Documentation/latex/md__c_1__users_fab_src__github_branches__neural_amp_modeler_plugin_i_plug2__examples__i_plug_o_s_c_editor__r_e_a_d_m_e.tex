Demonstrates how to use the Open Sound \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_control}{Control}} classes in i\+Plug2. It also shows how to use an \mbox{\hyperlink{class_i_web_view_control}{I\+Web\+View\+Control}} in an \mbox{\hyperlink{class_i_graphics}{I\+Graphics}} \mbox{\hyperlink{class_u_i}{UI}}.

Since this uses the Web\+View control, on Windows you will have to have downloaded and installed the latest edge chromium and you will have to right click the Visual Studio Solution/individual projects and install the nuget packages for I\+Core\+Web\+View2 and the Windows Implementation Library. Then you will have to edit some hard-\/coded paths In I\+Plug\+Web\+U\+I.\+cpp, since your plugin needs to be able to load the Web\+View2\+Loader.\+dll and it needs to have a temporary folder that it can write to. This does not set that up for you, so if you wanted to use this in a way that would work on computers other than your own, you would need to add some logic to the installer to find a dedicated path to install Web\+View2\+Loader.\+dll and for the temp dir.
