i\+Plug2 W\+DL Convo\+Engine example, based on I\+Plug convoengine example by Theo Niessink.

It can use
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://github.com/avaneev/r8brain-free-src}{\texttt{ r8brain}}
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{class_w_d_l___resampler}{W\+D\+L\+\_\+\+Resampler}}
\item or linear interpolation
\end{DoxyItemize}

you change that behaviour by setting U\+S\+E\+\_\+\+W\+D\+L\+\_\+\+R\+E\+S\+A\+M\+P\+L\+ER or U\+S\+E\+\_\+\+R8\+B\+R\+A\+IN as a preprocessor macro

r8brain source should be in the subdolder r8brain, and you need to add {\itshape r8bbase.\+cpp} to the targets you want to compile
