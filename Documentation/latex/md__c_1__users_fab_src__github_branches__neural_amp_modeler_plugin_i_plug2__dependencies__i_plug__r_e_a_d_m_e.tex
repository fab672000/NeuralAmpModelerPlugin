To build different formats of plug-\/in, you need to have the S\+D\+Ks in place here. Look inside each subfolder for a link showing you where to download the S\+DK.

You can run the bash shell script {\ttfamily download-\/iplug-\/sdks.\+sh} in a terminal (and via git-\/bash or other unix terminal emulator on Windows) to download some of the publicly available S\+D\+Ks automatically.
