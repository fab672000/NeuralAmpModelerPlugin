i\+Plug 2 is a simple-\/to-\/use C++ framework for developing cross-\/platform audio plug-\/ins/apps and targeting multiple plug-\/in A\+P\+Is with the same minimalistic code. It abstracts an audio plug-\/in (I\+Plug) and its drawing engine/\+G\+UI toolkit (\mbox{\hyperlink{class_i_graphics}{I\+Graphics}}). \mbox{\hyperlink{class_i_graphics}{I\+Graphics}} is a simple \mbox{\hyperlink{class_u_i}{UI}} toolkit with good performance which contains a collection of common controls well suited for audio plug-\/ins, either using bitmap or vector graphics. Alternatively \href{https://github.com/iPlug2/iPlug2/tree/master/Examples}{\texttt{ examples}} are included showing how you can use technologies such as H\+T\+M\+L/\+C\+SS or Swift\+UI on top of a C++ \mbox{\hyperlink{class_d_s_p}{D\+SP}} layer.

The recommended starting point for an i\+Plug2 project in 2023 can be found in a separate repo, \href{https://github.com/iPlug2/iPlug2OOS}{\texttt{ i\+Plug2\+O\+OS (out-\/of-\/source)}}

i\+Plug2 A\+PI Documentation is published \href{https://iplug2.github.io/docs}{\texttt{ here}} and be sure to check out the \href{https://github.com/iPlug2/iPlug2/wiki}{\texttt{ i\+Plug2 Wiki}}

The original version of i\+Plug was released in 2008 as part of Cockos\textquotesingle{} W\+DL library. i\+Plug 2 (2018) is a substantial reworking that brings multiple vector graphics backends to \mbox{\hyperlink{class_i_graphics}{I\+Graphics}} (including G\+PU accelerated options and Hi\+D\+P\+I/scaling), a better approach to concurrency, support for distributed plug-\/in formats and compiling to Web\+Assembly via \href{https://github.com/kripken/emscripten}{\texttt{ emscripten}}, amongst many other things.

i\+Plug 2 targets the V\+S\+T2, V\+S\+T3, A\+Uv2, A\+Uv3, A\+AX (Native) and the \href{https://webaudiomodules.org}{\texttt{ Web Audio Module}} (W\+AM) plug-\/in A\+P\+Is. It can also produce standalone win32/mac\+OS apps with audio and M\+I\+DI I/O, as well as \href{https://www.reaper.fm/sdk/plugin/plugin.php}{\texttt{ Reaper extensions}}. Windows 8, mac\+OS 10.\+11, and i\+OS 14 are the official minimum target platforms, but depending on the graphics backend used, you may be able to make it work on earlier operating systems.

i\+Plug 2 includes support for \href{http://faust.grame.fr}{\texttt{ the F\+A\+U\+ST programming language}}, and the libfaust J\+IT compiler. It was the winner of the 2018 F\+A\+U\+ST award.

i\+Plug 2 is licensed with a liberal zlib-\/like \href{https://github.com/iPlug2/iPlug2/blob/master/LICENSE.txt}{\texttt{ license}}, which means that it is free to use in closed source projects and is free from corporate interference.
