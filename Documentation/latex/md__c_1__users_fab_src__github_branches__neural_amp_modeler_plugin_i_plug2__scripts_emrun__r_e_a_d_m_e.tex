Self-\/sufficient tools for command line automation of browser and Firefox OS tasks. Often used with Emscripten.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item ffdb.\+py\+: {\bfseries{Firefox OS Debug Bridge}}, a command line tool for operating a Firefox OS device (install and run apps, log execution, etc).
\item emrun.\+py\+: {\bfseries{H\+T\+ML autorunner}}, run .html files from the command line as if they were native executables.
\item embench.\+py\+: {\bfseries{Benchmark runner}}, executes a given native or JS benchmark application and creates a visual .html page of the results. (planned, not yet implemented)

The tools in this repository are developed with the following areas of focus\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Depends on \href{https://www.python.org}{\texttt{ python}} and \href{http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html}{\texttt{ A\+DB}} installed on the system. No other dependencies.
\item Works on Windows, O\+SX and Linux.
\item Highly self-\/sufficient and embeddable. No installation steps needed, just copy the \mbox{\hyperlink{structfile}{file(s)}} for the tools you are interested in off this repository.
\item Usable both as a command line tool and embeddable as a library to other applications.
