Before we can use your code, you must sign the \href{https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual?csw=1}{\texttt{ Google Individual Contributor License Agreement}} (C\+LA), which you can do online. The C\+LA is necessary mainly because you own the copyright to your changes, even after your contribution becomes part of our codebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute your code. We also need to be sure of various other thingsâ€”for instance that you\textquotesingle{}ll tell us if you know that your code infringes on other people\textquotesingle{}s patents. You don\textquotesingle{}t have to sign the C\+LA until after you\textquotesingle{}ve submitted your code for review and a member has approved it, but you must do it before we can put your code into our codebase. Before you start working on a larger contribution, you should get in touch with us first through the issue tracker with your idea so that we can help out and possibly guide you. Coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoid frustration later on.\hypertarget{md__c_1__users_fab_src__github_branches__neural_amp_modeler_plugin_i_plug2__dependencies__build_b441a4b9afe74482f76db3b8852d8f89_autotoc_md696}{}\doxysubsubsection{Code reviews}\label{md__c_1__users_fab_src__github_branches__neural_amp_modeler_plugin_i_plug2__dependencies__build_b441a4b9afe74482f76db3b8852d8f89_autotoc_md696}
