\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Tensor expression classes. 

The Tensor\+Cwise\+Nullary\+Op class applies a nullary operators to an expression. This is typically used to generate constants.

The Tensor\+Cwise\+Unary\+Op class represents an expression where a unary operator (e.\+g. cwise\+Sqrt) is applied to an expression.

The Tensor\+Cwise\+Binary\+Op class represents an expression where a binary operator (e.\+g. addition) is applied to a lhs and a rhs expression. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
