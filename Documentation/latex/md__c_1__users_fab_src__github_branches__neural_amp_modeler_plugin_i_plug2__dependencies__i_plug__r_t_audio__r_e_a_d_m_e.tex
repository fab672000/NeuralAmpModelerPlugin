A set of C++ classes that provide a common A\+PI for realtime audio input/output across Linux (native A\+L\+SA, J\+A\+CK, Pulse\+Audio and O\+SS), Macintosh OS X (Core\+Audio and J\+A\+CK), and Windows (Direct\+Sound, A\+S\+IO and W\+A\+S\+A\+PI) operating systems.

\mbox{\hyperlink{class_rt_audio}{Rt\+Audio}} is a set of C++ classes that provides a common A\+PI (Application Programming Interface) for realtime audio input/output across Linux (native A\+L\+SA, J\+A\+CK, Pulse\+Audio and O\+SS), Macintosh OS X and Windows (Direct\+Sound, A\+S\+IO and W\+A\+S\+A\+PI) operating systems. \mbox{\hyperlink{class_rt_audio}{Rt\+Audio}} significantly simplifies the process of interacting with computer audio hardware. It was designed with the following objectives\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item object-\/oriented C++ design
\item simple, common A\+PI across all supported platforms
\item only one source and one header file for easy inclusion in programming projects
\item allow simultaneous multi-\/api support
\item support dynamic connection of devices
\item provide extensive audio device parameter control
\item allow audio device capability probing
\item automatic internal conversion for data format, channel number compensation, (de)interleaving, and byte-\/swapping
\end{DoxyItemize}

\mbox{\hyperlink{class_rt_audio}{Rt\+Audio}} incorporates the concept of audio streams, which represent audio output (playback) and/or input (recording). Available audio devices and their capabilities can be enumerated and then specified when opening a stream. Where applicable, multiple A\+PI support can be compiled and a particular A\+PI specified when creating an \mbox{\hyperlink{class_rt_audio}{Rt\+Audio}} instance. See the \mbox{\hyperlink{tutorial.txt_apinotes}{A\+PI Notes}} section for information specific to each of the supported audio A\+P\+Is.\hypertarget{md__c_1__users_fab_src__github_branches__neural_amp_modeler_plugin_i_plug2__dependencies__i_plug__r_t_audio__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1360}{}\doxysection{Further Reading}\label{md__c_1__users_fab_src__github_branches__neural_amp_modeler_plugin_i_plug2__dependencies__i_plug__r_t_audio__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1360}
