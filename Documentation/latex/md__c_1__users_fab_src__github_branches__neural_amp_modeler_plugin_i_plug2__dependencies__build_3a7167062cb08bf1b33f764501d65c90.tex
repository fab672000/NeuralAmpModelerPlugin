The J\+NI interface of the \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_faust}{Faust}} support for Android can be regenerated at any point simply by running the following command from {\ttfamily /architecture/api/android}\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{swig -\/java -\/package com.DspFaust -\/includeall -\/verbose -\/outdir jni -\/c++ -\/I/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Headers -\/Ijni -\/I../ -\/o jni/java\_interface\_wrap.cpp jni/dsp\_faust\_interface.i}
\end{DoxyCode}


This command should work both on Linux and O\+SX. This might be useful in case new methods are added to {\ttfamily /architecture/api/android/\+Dsp\+Faust.h}.
