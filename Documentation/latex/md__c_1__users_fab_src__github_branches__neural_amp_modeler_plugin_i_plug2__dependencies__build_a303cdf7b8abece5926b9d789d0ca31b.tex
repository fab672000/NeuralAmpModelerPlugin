Creates an output (playback) stream and plays a sine wave when you tap the screen.

Here\textquotesingle{}s an overview of the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_u_i}{UI}}\+:

{\bfseries{Audio A\+PI\+:}} Leave as \char`\"{}\+Unspecified\char`\"{} to select the best audio A\+PI for the current A\+PI level, or select A\+Audio or Open\+SL ES to force the use of that A\+PI. A\+Audio is only available on Android A\+PI 26 and above.

{\bfseries{Audio device\+:}} Choose the audio device, or leave as \char`\"{}\+Automatic\char`\"{} to use the default device. The list of audio devices is automatically updated when devices (e.\+g. headphones, U\+SB audio devices) are added or removed.

{\bfseries{Channel count\+:}} Choose the number of audio channels to output. A different pitched sine wave will be played through each of the channels.

{\bfseries{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_buffer}{Buffer}} size\+:}} Choose the buffer size in bursts. A burst is an array of audio frames read by the audio device in a single operation and typically represents the minimum possible buffer size.

{\bfseries{Latency\+:}} Shows the average latency of the audio stream between data entering the stream and it being presented to the audio device. This latency figure is only as accurate as the timestamps being reported by the audio device to the Android audio framework. It does not include any latency introduced {\itshape after} the audio device (e.\+g. echo cancellation for the built-\/in speaker). Only available on A\+PI 26+.\hypertarget{md__c_1__users_fab_src__github_branches__neural_amp_modeler_plugin_i_plug2__dependencies__build_a303cdf7b8abece5926b9d789d0ca31b_autotoc_md1105}{}\doxysection{Screenshots}\label{md__c_1__users_fab_src__github_branches__neural_amp_modeler_plugin_i_plug2__dependencies__build_a303cdf7b8abece5926b9d789d0ca31b_autotoc_md1105}
