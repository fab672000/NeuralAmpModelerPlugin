The effects included are designed to be as portable as possible, as well as making it easy to add additional effects.\hypertarget{md__c_1__users_fab_src__github_branches__neural_amp_modeler_plugin_i_plug2__dependencies__build_69a10b7a4057acf47d3fe9e8054f3b5b_autotoc_md656}{}\doxysection{Building}\label{md__c_1__users_fab_src__github_branches__neural_amp_modeler_plugin_i_plug2__dependencies__build_69a10b7a4057acf47d3fe9e8054f3b5b_autotoc_md656}
To build the app, simply open the project in android studio and build. The app integrates Oboe via a git submodule. Make sure when cloning the repository to clone the submodule as well using {\ttfamily git clone -\/-\/recursive}, or {\ttfamily git submodule update -\/-\/init -\/-\/recursive}.

To update the version of Oboe being used, descend into the Oboe repository \href{../app/src/main/cpp}{\texttt{ (oboe location)}} and update from its remote. Then, call {\ttfamily git submodule update} in this repository. Alternatively {\ttfamily git submodule update -\/-\/recursive -\/-\/remote} will pull the latest version of Oboe from remote.

Although the C\+Make file requires android headers (to use Oboe), the effects themselves can be compiled with any C++17 compliant compiler.\hypertarget{md__c_1__users_fab_src__github_branches__neural_amp_modeler_plugin_i_plug2__dependencies__build_69a10b7a4057acf47d3fe9e8054f3b5b_autotoc_md657}{}\doxysection{Architecture}\label{md__c_1__users_fab_src__github_branches__neural_amp_modeler_plugin_i_plug2__dependencies__build_69a10b7a4057acf47d3fe9e8054f3b5b_autotoc_md657}
The \mbox{\hyperlink{class_u_i}{UI}} code (Kotlin) calls native code through the J\+NI bridge to query information about the various effects implemented, and how to render the effect information in the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_u_i}{UI}}. This means that adding an effect only needs to be done on the native side. The J\+NI bridge passes information regarding implemented effects descriptions to the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_u_i}{UI}} as well as functions called when the user modifies effects in the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_u_i}{UI}}.

The {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_duplex_engine}{Duplex\+Engine}}} is responsible for managing and syncing the input and output Oboe streams for rendering audio with as low latency as possible. The {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_function_list}{Function\+List}}} class contains the a vector of effects that correspond to the list of effects (and their parameters) that the user wants to use to process their audio. Effects (and the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_function_list}{Function\+List}}}) overload their function operator to take in two numeric iterator types. E.\+g {\ttfamily $<$template iter\+\_\+type$>$ void operator() (iter\+\_\+type begin, iter\+\_\+type end)}, where the {\ttfamily iter\+\_\+types} correspond to C++ iterators carrying audio data. To erase the type of different objects, the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_function_list}{Function\+List}}} holds objects of types {\ttfamily std\+::function$<$void(iter\+\_\+type, iter\+\_\+type)$>$} i.\+e. functions which operate on the range between two numeric iterators in place. The {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_duplex_engine}{Duplex\+Engine}}}simply calls the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_function_list}{Function\+List}}} on every buffer of samples it receives.

The effects folder contains the classes of various implemented effects. It also contains {\ttfamily Effects.\+h} where a global tuple of all the Effect descriptions implemented lives. The description folder contains the description for all of the effects. Each description takes the form of a class with static methods providing information regarding the effect (including name, category, parameters, and a factory method).\hypertarget{md__c_1__users_fab_src__github_branches__neural_amp_modeler_plugin_i_plug2__dependencies__build_69a10b7a4057acf47d3fe9e8054f3b5b_autotoc_md658}{}\doxysection{Adding Effects}\label{md__c_1__users_fab_src__github_branches__neural_amp_modeler_plugin_i_plug2__dependencies__build_69a10b7a4057acf47d3fe9e8054f3b5b_autotoc_md658}
To add an effect, simply add a Description class similar to the existing classes, and add the class to the tuple in {\ttfamily Effects.\+h}. The description must provide a way to build the effect by either constructing another class corresponding to an effect, or pointing to a standalone function. Adding new effects is welcome!\hypertarget{md__c_1__users_fab_src__github_branches__neural_amp_modeler_plugin_i_plug2__dependencies__build_69a10b7a4057acf47d3fe9e8054f3b5b_autotoc_md659}{}\doxysection{Existing Effects}\label{md__c_1__users_fab_src__github_branches__neural_amp_modeler_plugin_i_plug2__dependencies__build_69a10b7a4057acf47d3fe9e8054f3b5b_autotoc_md659}
A instructional implemented effect to examine is the {\ttfamily Tremolo\+Effect.\+h} (a modulating gain). Many of the effects in the delay category inherit from {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_delay_line_effect}{Delay\+Line\+Effect}}} which provides a framework to easily implement many delay based effects, as well as the comb filter effects (F\+IR, I\+IR, allpass). The slides have a block diagram displaying the mathematical basis of the effect. The nonlinear effects (distortion and overdrive) are implemented using a standalone function (from {\ttfamily Single\+Effect\+Functions.\+h}. The gain effect is implemented by a simple lambda in its description class.
