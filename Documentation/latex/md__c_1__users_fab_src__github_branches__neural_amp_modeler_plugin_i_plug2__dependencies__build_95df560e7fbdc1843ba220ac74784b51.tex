This folder contains some of the old \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_faust}{Faust}} examples that were using functions from libraries that are considered to not be \char`\"{}standard\char`\"{} anymore. It could be called the \char`\"{}legacy\char`\"{} folder \+:). Since old \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_faust}{Faust}} libraries are sill implemented using a series {\ttfamily import} of the new libraries, all these files should still work!\hypertarget{md__c_1__users_fab_src__github_branches__neural_amp_modeler_plugin_i_plug2__dependencies__build_95df560e7fbdc1843ba220ac74784b51_autotoc_md892}{}\doxysubsection{Thoughts}\label{md__c_1__users_fab_src__github_branches__neural_amp_modeler_plugin_i_plug2__dependencies__build_95df560e7fbdc1843ba220ac74784b51_autotoc_md892}

\item Maybe the examples based on maxmsp.\+lib should be in a separate library
