As of October 2018, \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_steinberg}{Steinberg}} no longer allows the distribution of V\+S\+T2 plug-\/ins unless you have a signed agreement. For those developers who did obtain a signed agreement before October 2018, and who still have a copy of the V\+S\+T2 S\+DK (or V\+S\+T3 S\+DK $<$ 3.\+6.\+11, which contained the relevant header files), read on, otherwise you best think about other plug-\/in formats...

put {\itshape \mbox{\hyperlink{aeffect_8h_source}{aeffect.\+h}}} and {\itshape \mbox{\hyperlink{aeffectx_8h_source}{aeffectx.\+h}}} from the V\+S\+T2.\+4 S\+DK here

these are the files you need to put in this folder

{\ttfamily /\+V\+S\+T2\+\_\+\+S\+D\+K/pluginterfaces/vst2.\mbox{\hyperlink{aeffect_8h_source}{x/aeffect.\+h}}} ~\newline
 {\ttfamily /\+V\+S\+T2\+\_\+\+S\+D\+K/pluginterfaces/vst2.\mbox{\hyperlink{aeffectx_8h_source}{x/aeffectx.\+h}}} ~\newline


so it looks like\+:

{\ttfamily Dependencies/\+I\+Plug/\+V\+S\+T2\+\_\+\+S\+D\+K/} ~\newline
 {\ttfamily Dependencies/\+I\+Plug/\+V\+S\+T2\+\_\+\+S\+D\+K/aeffect.\+h} ~\newline
 {\ttfamily Dependencies/\+I\+Plug/\+V\+S\+T2\+\_\+\+S\+D\+K/aeffectx.\+h} ~\newline
