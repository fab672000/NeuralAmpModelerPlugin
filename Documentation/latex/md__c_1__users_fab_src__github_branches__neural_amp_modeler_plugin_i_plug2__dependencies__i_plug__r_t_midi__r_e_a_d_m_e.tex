A set of C++ classes that provide a common A\+PI for realtime M\+I\+DI input/output across Linux (A\+L\+SA \& J\+A\+CK), Macintosh OS X (Core\+M\+I\+DI \& J\+A\+CK) and Windows (Multimedia).

This distribution of \mbox{\hyperlink{class_rt_midi}{Rt\+Midi}} contains the following\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily doc}\+: \mbox{\hyperlink{class_rt_midi}{Rt\+Midi}} documentation (also online at \href{http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~gary/rtmidi/}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+music.\+mcgill.\+ca/$\sim$gary/rtmidi/}})
\item {\ttfamily tests}\+: example \mbox{\hyperlink{class_rt_midi}{Rt\+Midi}} programs
\end{DoxyItemize}

On Unix systems, type {\ttfamily ./configure} in the top level directory, then {\ttfamily make} in the {\ttfamily tests/} directory to compile the test programs. In Windows, open the Visual C++ workspace file located in the {\ttfamily tests/} directory.

If you checked out the code from git, please run {\ttfamily ./autogen.sh} before {\ttfamily ./configure}.\hypertarget{md__c_1__users_fab_src__github_branches__neural_amp_modeler_plugin_i_plug2__dependencies__i_plug__r_t_midi__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1363}{}\doxysection{Overview}\label{md__c_1__users_fab_src__github_branches__neural_amp_modeler_plugin_i_plug2__dependencies__i_plug__r_t_midi__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1363}
\mbox{\hyperlink{class_rt_midi}{Rt\+Midi}} is a set of C++ classes ({\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_rt_midi_in}{Rt\+Midi\+In}}}, {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_rt_midi_out}{Rt\+Midi\+Out}}}, and A\+PI specific classes) that provide a common A\+PI (Application Programming Interface) for realtime M\+I\+DI input/output across Linux (A\+L\+SA, J\+A\+CK), Macintosh OS X (Core\+M\+I\+DI, J\+A\+CK), and Windows (Multimedia Library) operating systems. \mbox{\hyperlink{class_rt_midi}{Rt\+Midi}} significantly simplifies the process of interacting with computer M\+I\+DI hardware and software. It was designed with the following goals\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item object oriented C++ design
\item simple, common A\+PI across all supported platforms
\item only one header and one source file for easy inclusion in programming projects
\item M\+I\+DI device enumeration
\end{DoxyItemize}

M\+I\+DI input and output functionality are separated into two classes, {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_rt_midi_in}{Rt\+Midi\+In}}} and {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_rt_midi_out}{Rt\+Midi\+Out}}}. Each class instance supports only a single M\+I\+DI connection. \mbox{\hyperlink{class_rt_midi}{Rt\+Midi}} does not provide timing functionality (i.\+e., output messages are sent immediately). Input messages are timestamped with delta times in seconds (via a {\ttfamily double} floating point type). M\+I\+DI data is passed to the user as raw bytes using an {\ttfamily std\+::vector$<$unsigned char$>$}.\hypertarget{md__c_1__users_fab_src__github_branches__neural_amp_modeler_plugin_i_plug2__dependencies__i_plug__r_t_midi__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1364}{}\doxysection{Windows}\label{md__c_1__users_fab_src__github_branches__neural_amp_modeler_plugin_i_plug2__dependencies__i_plug__r_t_midi__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1364}
In some cases, for example to use \mbox{\hyperlink{class_rt_midi}{Rt\+Midi}} with GS \mbox{\hyperlink{class_synth}{Synth}}, it may be necessary for your program to call {\ttfamily Co\+Initialize\+Ex} and {\ttfamily Co\+Uninitialize} on entry to and exit from the thread that uses \mbox{\hyperlink{class_rt_midi}{Rt\+Midi}}.\hypertarget{md__c_1__users_fab_src__github_branches__neural_amp_modeler_plugin_i_plug2__dependencies__i_plug__r_t_midi__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1365}{}\doxysection{Further reading}\label{md__c_1__users_fab_src__github_branches__neural_amp_modeler_plugin_i_plug2__dependencies__i_plug__r_t_midi__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1365}
