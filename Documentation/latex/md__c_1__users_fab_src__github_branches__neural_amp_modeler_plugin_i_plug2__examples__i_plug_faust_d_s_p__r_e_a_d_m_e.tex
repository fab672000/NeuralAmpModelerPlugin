A plug-\/in that uses F\+A\+U\+ST to implement its \mbox{\hyperlink{class_d_s_p}{D\+SP}} and J\+I\+T-\/compile F\+A\+U\+ST code (using libfaust) in debug builds.

i\+Plug2 F\+A\+U\+ST integration was presented at the International \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_faust}{Faust}} Conference (I\+FC 2018).

\item J\+IT compilation will only work on mac\+OS and Windows (i\+OS doesn\textquotesingle{}t allow J\+IT compilation)
\item i\+Plug2 \char`\"{}pre-\/built libraries\char`\"{} zips contains a build of faust for mac and windows designed to work with this project. If you know what you are doing you can use your own build of faust, but warning\+: it is very complicated on Windows.
\item i\+Plug2 project preprocessor directives to choose the various paths for the faust dependencies are set in the .xcconfig and .props files that reside in the /config folder of a project.
\item The preprocessor directive {\itshape D\+S\+P\+\_\+\+F\+I\+LE} specified in debug builds is a hardcoded path to the F\+A\+U\+ST .dsp file. You may need to modifiy that path in order for the J\+IT compilation to work.
\item The preprocessor directive {\itshape F\+A\+U\+S\+T\+\_\+\+S\+H\+A\+R\+E\+\_\+\+P\+A\+TH} can be set to specify the install paths for faust libraries like stdfaust.\+lib. By default it looks in the standard faust install path, so if you didn\textquotesingle{}t install faust the compilation will fail.
\item The preprocessor directive {\itshape F\+A\+U\+S\+T\+\_\+\+C\+O\+M\+P\+I\+L\+ED} is specified in release builds to take out the libfaust J\+IT compiler and just use the \mbox{\hyperlink{_faust_code_8hpp_source}{Faust\+Code.\+hpp}} file (the generated C++ code). If the J\+IT compiler is not working for you, you can disable it (with the F\+A\+U\+S\+T\+\_\+\+C\+O\+M\+P\+I\+L\+ED macro) and complile the faust .dsp file to C++ using the command line faust executable.
\item Since this project watches a F\+A\+U\+ST .dsp file on disk, It must be able to access the file via the filesystem. In the case of mac\+OS, if the app is running in the app-\/sandbox, it\textquotesingle{}s likely that it can\textquotesingle{}t load the .dsp file or the faust library files and will trigger an assertion. In order to disable the app sandbox you can make sure the \char`\"{}\+Code signing identity\char`\"{} field is empty in the xcode project target build settings.
\item On Windows there are currently some issues with the libfaust compiler, so you may have to manually compile the C++ file, for example assuming you have F\+A\+U\+ST installed and in your P\+A\+TH you could compile it like this on the command line\+:
