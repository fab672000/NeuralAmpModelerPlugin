This app performs real-\/time audio effects with low latency using the \href{https://www.github.com/google/oboe}{\texttt{ oboe}} A\+PI.

The audio effects are written natively (in C++), with Kotlin used for the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_u_i}{UI}}.

Supported features include a linear pipeline of real-\/time effects with re-\/ordering, enable/disable, and parameter modification.

The effects used should be portable as they operate entirely on numeric type iterators.\hypertarget{md__c_1__users_fab_src__github_branches__neural_amp_modeler_plugin_i_plug2__dependencies__build_cd18b87fae90380af6b0fc36f20b47cc_autotoc_md329}{}\doxysection{Setup}\label{md__c_1__users_fab_src__github_branches__neural_amp_modeler_plugin_i_plug2__dependencies__build_cd18b87fae90380af6b0fc36f20b47cc_autotoc_md329}
Connect the android device to the correct audio input and output devices. A simple use-\/case could be a headset with a microphone while singing or playing an acoustic instrument near the mic. More complicated setups could involve U\+SB audio interfaces, devices such as the i\+Rig 2 interface for guitar effects/amplification or routing audio output to a computer for a recording.\hypertarget{md__c_1__users_fab_src__github_branches__neural_amp_modeler_plugin_i_plug2__dependencies__build_cd18b87fae90380af6b0fc36f20b47cc_autotoc_md330}{}\doxysection{Layout}\label{md__c_1__users_fab_src__github_branches__neural_amp_modeler_plugin_i_plug2__dependencies__build_cd18b87fae90380af6b0fc36f20b47cc_autotoc_md330}


Tap the plus button to add various effects. The current list of effects being applied to the input audio will be shown on the main screen (in order from top to bottom). Use the drag handles on the right of the effect to re-\/order the effects. Swiping the effect near the title to the right or left will remove the effect. Use the sliders to modify the parameters of each audio effect. Some effect combinations or parameters might lead to unpleasant sounds!

By default the sound output is off when you start the app (this is to avoid a feedback loop if you\textquotesingle{}re not using headphones). Tap the \char`\"{}\+Unmute\char`\"{} button in the top right corner to enable sound output.\hypertarget{md__c_1__users_fab_src__github_branches__neural_amp_modeler_plugin_i_plug2__dependencies__build_cd18b87fae90380af6b0fc36f20b47cc_autotoc_md331}{}\doxysection{Development}\label{md__c_1__users_fab_src__github_branches__neural_amp_modeler_plugin_i_plug2__dependencies__build_cd18b87fae90380af6b0fc36f20b47cc_autotoc_md331}
