The \mbox{\hyperlink{class_rt_audio}{Rt\+Audio}} A\+PI incorporates many of the concepts developed in the \href{http://www.portaudio.com/}{\texttt{ Port\+Audio}} project by Phil Burk and Ross Bencina. Early development also incorporated ideas from Bill Schottstaedt\textquotesingle{}s \href{http://www-ccrma.stanford.edu/software/snd/sndlib/}{\texttt{ sndlib}}. The C\+C\+R\+MA \href{http://www-ccrma.stanford.edu/groups/soundwire/}{\texttt{ Sound\+Wire group}} provided valuable feedback during the A\+PI proposal stages.

The early 2.\+0 version of \mbox{\hyperlink{class_rt_audio}{Rt\+Audio}} was slowly developed over the course of many months while in residence at the \href{http://www.iua.upf.es/}{\texttt{ Institut Universitari de L\textquotesingle{}Audiovisual (I\+UA)}} in Barcelona, Spain and the \href{http://www.acoustics.hut.fi/}{\texttt{ Laboratory of Acoustics and Audio Signal Processing}} at the Helsinki University of Technology, Finland. Much subsequent development happened while working at the \href{http://www-ccrma.stanford.edu/}{\texttt{ Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (C\+C\+R\+MA)}} at \href{http://www.stanford.edu/}{\texttt{ Stanford University}}. All recent versions of \mbox{\hyperlink{class_rt_audio}{Rt\+Audio}} have been completed while working as an assistant / associate professor of \href{http://www.music.mcgill.ca/musictech/}{\texttt{ Music Technology}} at \href{http://www.mcgill.ca/}{\texttt{ Mc\+Gill University}}. This work was supported in part by the United States Air Force Office of Scientific Research (grant \#F49620-\/99-\/1-\/0293).
